## Purpose of the Web App

This Web Application serves the purpose of seeing the relationship between Miles per Gallon (mpg) and Horsepower (hp).

## Data

The data used for the interactive plot is from the mtcars dataset which comes preinstalled with RStudio.

## Guide

You can highlight an area in the plot and you will get a linear regresson model showing the relationship between mpg and hp for the selected points. You will also get a regression line for only the selected points.
